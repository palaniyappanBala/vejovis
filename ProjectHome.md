Hackers employ different ways to bypass the traditional scanning methods used by anti-viruses through the use of packers/cryptors. MeMMoN was developed to combat such malwares.

This tool monitors the memory of all the process in the windows system for malicious code.

MeMMoN is very efficient in detecting known malware variants with new protection(packers).

MeMMoN can also be used as a malware variant classification tool.

MeMMoN runs as a light weight thread consuming very less resources. This tool works well against packed/protected/crypted executables.
